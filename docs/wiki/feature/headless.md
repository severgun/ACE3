## 1. Overview

Enables automatic passing of AI groups to (up to 3) Headless Clients using round-robin system, with automatic Headless Client recognition. Due to the fully event-based transferring (on unit spawn and on Headless Client connect and disconnect) the performance impact is minimal. It also transfers *groups* of units instead of each unit separately.
